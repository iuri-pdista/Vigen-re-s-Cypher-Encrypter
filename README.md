# Vigenère's  Cypher Encrypter
## A Vigenère's Cypher Encrypter made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
Vigenere's cypher, is a type of cypher that sums the numeric value of a letter, based on its position in the alphabet, from a word, with a letter in the same postion.

### For example:

if we have aeiou as our key, and we want to encrypt the word Iuri, so we must do
I+a, u+e, r+i, i+o
and we going to get the following result jzax, or the numeric form 10/26/1/24

### How do I use it?

You Just need to type the word you want to encrypt, then type the key, and the the last thing is to click submit, and it is done :tada: :tada: .
